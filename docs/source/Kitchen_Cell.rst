Salamander Broiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Key Frames:**

.. csv-table:: Appliance Key Frames
   :header: "Frame ID", "X (mm)", "Y (mm)", Z (mm)
   :widths: 30, 15, 15, 15

   "Upper Shelf Inserted", 100, 100, 100
   "Upper Shelf Removed", 100, 100, 100
   "Lower Shelf Inserted", 100, 100, 100
   "Lower Shelf Removed", 100, 100, 100
   
**Modifications:**

*Replaced external knobs with servo motors to control electrical functions.
*Implanted K-Type thermocouple to top heating element
*Replaced internal shelving with more easily navigable ones.

**Setup:**

*Mounted to the shelf via an angle bracket mounted beneath the device.
*The ventilation hood is mounted via screws to the top of the salamander broiler.
 
**Future Work?:**

*May be useful to replace shelves with a rising platform for more control over cooking.
   *Modifying a small aluminum scissor lift with a motor would be a fairly straightforward solution.
*Making the ventilation mount system more robust (ie. having more specific screw holes rather than the vent it currently uses).
   *If sticking with shelves, replace plastic ones with modified aluminum brackets.

Convection Oven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Key Frames:**

.. csv-table:: Appliance Key Frames
   :header: "Frame ID", "X (mm)", "Y (mm)", Z (mm)
   :widths: 30, 15, 15, 15

   "Door Closed", 100, 100, 100
   "Door Opened", 100, 100, 100
   "Pan Inserted", 100, 100, 100
   "Pan Removed", 100, 100, 100
   
**Modifications:**

*Replaced external knobs with analog solid state relay to control heating element and fan.
*Implanted K-Type thermocouple into the cooking chamber.
*Attached rotating tool plate for door manipulation.

**Setup:**

*Mounted to the shelf via an angle bracket mounted beneath the device.
*The ventilation hood is mounted via screws drilled into the top of the oven.
 
**Future Work?:**

*Rotating tool plate will need to be finalized.
   *Modifying for proper april tag placement.
   *Adding magnets and guides for consitant alignment.
*Add internal metal alignment guides for pan insertion.
   *May also incorporate some form of temperature sensing to measure pan temperature.
